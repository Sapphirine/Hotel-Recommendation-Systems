To run the python code first follow the instruction in GitHub[1][2] to install the pywFM and XGBoost library. In the project.py file, first we import all libraries and show a simple example of applying Factorization Machine as well as the data structure. Then we do data pre-processing work and divide the data set into train set and test set. The following parts are applying Model I (Random Forest + Popularity Ranking)and Model II (Factorization Machine + XGBoost).
